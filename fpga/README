Build SOC with
--------------
- rv32i
- CSR
- CLIC (Timer and ecall)
- PLIC (External UART)
- GPIO
- UART
- BRAM (firmware + bootloader)
- SRAM (software)

1.	CPU with GPIO Assembler and C-runtime
	- leds
	- blinky (cycles CSR)

2.	UART with Assembler, C-runtime
	- hello
	- echo
	- buffer

3.	SRAM with C-runtime
	- load
	- dump
	- exec

4.	CLIC and PLIC in Assembler and C-runtime

5.	run UNIX V6!
